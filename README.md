# DCGAN

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. The model is designed to generate realistic images based on a given dataset.

## Features
- Uses a Generator and a Discriminator network trained adversarially.
- Leverages convolutional and batch normalization layers for stability.
- Supports training on custom datasets.
- Outputs generated images at various training epochs.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow torch torchvision
```

## Usage
1. Open the `DCGAN.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Configure the dataset path and hyperparameters.
3. Run all cells sequentially to train the model.
4. Generated images will be saved periodically in the output directory.

## Dataset
- The notebook expects an image dataset.
- Ensure images are preprocessed correctly (resized, normalized).
- Modify the data loading section if using a different dataset.

## Output
- The Generator will output fake images at different epochs.
- Loss graphs of the Generator and Discriminator will be plotted.
- Final trained model weights can be saved for future use.

## Notes
- Training GANs requires significant computational power. Consider using GPU acceleration (e.g., Google Colab with a GPU runtime).
- If mode collapse occurs, try tuning the learning rate or modifying the architecture.
